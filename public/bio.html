    <p class="font1">I have been in the arts for over 20 years as a professional Actor and Singer. My first love has always been music. This is what brings me true joy.</p>
    <br />
    <p class="font1">A lifelong traveler, I have worked and lived all over the Country. States I have lived in include Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Arizona, Washington, Michigan, Illinois and New York (where I was born and raised). While working in Yellowstone National Park for 6 seasons, I fell in love with Bozeman and I am glad to call it home.</p>
